    <p> My experience so far has been strongly focused on learning by doing, especially in programming and web development. I have spent a lot of time working with C++ and ncurses, debugging errors, understanding game loops, and improving my logic through practice. Alongside this, I have explored core HTML concepts such as semantic tags, iframes, and embedding external content. By consistently asking questions and refining my code, I have built a solid foundation in problem-solving and technical understanding. These experiences have helped me grow more confident in handling both errors and new challenges.</p>
